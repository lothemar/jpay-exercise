# Installation

There are two Dockerfiles, one for the backend and one for the frontend. Run both of them to get the application running.

Backend uses port 8080, and frontend uses 3000. This is noted to avoid any potential conflicts.

To run either please build the image first using `docker build <desired-image-name>`

Afterwards run it in a container using `docker run`.
